	<p>I'm a front end developer originally from Seattle, WA, USA and currently based in Oaxaca, Mexico. Along with a strong base of skills — Wordpress, HTML5, CSS/SCSS, Javascript, PHP — I'm particularly interested in web accessibility and inclusivity. I've always been amazed and intrigued by the possibilities of the internet, but while the internet has grown exponentially, many people are unable to access this new digital world.</p>
